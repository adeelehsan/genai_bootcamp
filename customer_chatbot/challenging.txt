CHALLENGE 1: Empty Results from MCP Client
-------------------------------------------
Problem: MCP client connected but returned empty strings.

Solution: Assumed response was at result.result but actual data was at result.content[0].text


CHALLENGE 2: Search Doesn't Handle Plurals
------------------------------------------
Problem: "monitors" returned 0 results, "monitor" returned 40 results. Server does exact substring matching.

Solution: Added fallback to retry without trailing 's':
    if "No products found" in result and query.endswith('s'):
        result = self.call_tool("search_products", {"query": query[:-1]})


CHALLENGE 3: LLM Not Displaying Tool Results
--------------------------------------------
Problem: Chatbot called tools and got 3791 chars of product data, but final response didn't show products to user.

Solution: Added explicit instruction after tool results:
    messages.append({
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Display these results to me as a helpful assistant. Use plain text, not code. Show the top 10 products."
    })
